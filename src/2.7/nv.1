.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I nv
allows users to transmit and receive slow frame rate video via UDP/IP across
an internet. Video streams can be either sent point to point, or sent to
several destinations simultaneously using IP multicast. Receivers need no
special hardware \(em just an X display. Transmitters need a Sun VideoPix frame
grabber, or an SGI IRIS Indigo with the IndigoVideo board. Additional video
capture support will be added in future releases.
.PP
The video transmitted is a 320x240 image with 128 levels of greyscale for NTSC
sources and 384x288 with 128 levels of greyscale for PAL sources. The frame
rate varies based on system load, but tends to be between 3 and 5 frames/second
on a SPARCstation 2 and as much as 10\-15 frames/second on an Indigo. The image
is updated at varying resolutions based on the amount of motion and the
bandwidth available. As the image motion slows down, high resolution data is
sent to fill in lost detail.

.SH OPTIONS
.I nv
allows you to specify various options either on the command line or using X
resources. The list of options is as follows:
.LP
.RS
.nf
.ta \w'-maxBandwidth   'u +\w'nv.maxBandwidth:   'u
.I "Option	X Resource	Default"
-brightness	Nv.brightness:	60
-contrast	Nv.contrast:	60
-interface	Nv.interface:	(primary host name)
-maxBandwidth	Nv.maxBandwidth:	128
-maxFrameRate	Nv.maxFrameRate:	(machine-specific value)
-name	Nv.name:	(username@localhostname)
-recvSize	Nv.recvSize:	normal
-ttl	Nv.ttl:	16

.PP
All options can be abbreviated to their smallest unique subset (generally a
single letter). In addition to the above list, nv understands the standard
X switch of "-display" to use something other than $DISPLAY.
.PP
The brightness & contrast parameters range from 0 to 100. The maxBandwidth is
specified in kbits/second. The TTL can range from 0 to 255.
.PP
For transmitters, the maxFrameRate parameter ranges from 0 to 15 frames/second,
where 0 is a machine-specific default value.
The default frame rate on the Indigo is 10 frames/sec.  
.PP
The interface option controls which of the network interfaces is used when
sending. It should be set to the primary multicast interface on a multi-homed
host. Normally, it defaults to the interface corresponding to the primary
host name.
.PP
The recvSize option sets the default size for incoming video windows. It can
be set to half, normal, or double.
.PP
After the options, you can specify a destination address and port number. If
neither is specified, a default address of 224.2.1.0 and port of 4444 is used.
Specifying a unicast address allows for a point-to-point connection.  If a
multicast group address is used, it is taken to be the address both to transmit
to and listen for other transmitters on.
.\"-------------
.SH CONTROLS
.I nv
brings up a control panel when it is run which consists of two or three main
regions, depending on whether a supported video capture board is available.
The top region is a list of currently available network video sources \(em a
list of names with a checkbox next to each. Clicking on a name will toggle
whether the video from that source is being displayed. The second region
contains conference address info, as well as a place to set your name. Each of
these fields may be editted \(em changes take affect when <Return> is pressed
in a field. The third region appears only when a video capture board is found.
It allows you to set the maximum transmit bandwidth for your video stream, and
toggle sending on and off. It also has a button to bring up a list of sites
reporting in as viewing you.
.PP
Clicking in incoming video windows will toggle an extra control panel which
allows you to adjust the brightness and contrast of the image. It also displays
the incoming frame rate and bandwidth (averaged over the last few seconds).
Other controls include a set of window size buttons, and a button which allows
you to capture the current image into a new window.  To make the captured
windows disappear, click in them.
.PP
To exit the program, type Ctrl-C or 'q' in the control panel.

.SH BUGS
.I nv
presently doesn't deal properly with "delete window" requests from X. That will
be handled correctly when the next version of the Tk toolkit is released.
.LP
When you start nv on an Indigo with the IndigoVideo board, the following
message may appear several times in the console window: "sv1LoadMap: bad
sv1AddWork".  It's caused by an IndigoVideo driver bug and can be ignored.
.LP
Additional bug reports, or other comments and suggestions are always welcome
via email.
