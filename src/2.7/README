This is the source distribution of the 'nv' network video tool. The actual
sources can be found in the "src" subdirectory. Two build directories, for
the sun4 and the sgi are also included, with a simple Makefile. Some paths
in the makefile will need to be set to appropriate local values.

In order to actually build 'nv', you will need Tcl 6.4 and Tk 2.3 installed on
the system. It also requires the VideoPix library on the SPARCstation, or the
IndigoVideo "svideo" library on the Indigo.

'nv' is still very much a work in progress, but hopefully you will find the
program adequate for basic unicast and multicast transmission of video across
the Internet. Comments and suggestions, as well as bug report, are extremely
welcome! Please send any such comments via email to the author, Ron Frederick
