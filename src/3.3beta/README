This is the source distribution of the 'nv' network video tool. The actual
sources can be found in the "src" subdirectory. The "cpv" directory contains
binary versions of the ViewPoint CPV decoder which cannot be distributed in
source form. The Makefile in the "src" directory will need to be customized
to point at the right places for include files and libraries, and to select
which grabbers to support.

In order to actually build 'nv', you will need Tcl 7.3 and Tk 3.6 installed on
the system. They can be picked up from the ftp site ftp.cs.berkeley.edu in the
directory /ucb/tcl. To be able to compile a version of nv which can send video,
you may need additional grabber specific libraries such as the VideoPix library
on the SPARCstation or VL library on the SGI Indy.

'nv' is still very much a work in progress, but hopefully you will find the
program adequate for basic unicast and multicast transmission of video across
the Internet. Comments and suggestions, as well as bug reports, are extremely
welcome! Please send any such comments via email to the author, Ron Frederick
