This is the source distribution of the 'nv' network video tool. The actual
sources can be found in the "src" subdirectory. Build directories are included
for the Sun 4, SGI, Sony NEWS, and DECstation 5000 platforms. Each has a
simple Makefile which you'll probably need to customize slightly.

In order to actually build 'nv', you will need Tcl 6.7 and Tk 3.2 installed on
the system. It also requires the VideoPix library on the SPARCstation, the
IndigoVideo "svideo" library on the SGI Indigo, and the PIP Xv library on the
DECstation.

'nv' is still very much a work in progress, but hopefully you will find the
program adequate for basic unicast and multicast transmission of video across
the Internet. Comments and suggestions, as well as bug report, are extremely
welcome! Please send any such comments via email to the author, Ron Frederick
