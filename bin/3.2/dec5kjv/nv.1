.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I nv
allows users to transmit and receive slow frame rate video via UDP/IP across
an internet. Video streams can be either sent point to point, or sent to
several destinations simultaneously using IP multicast. Receivers need no
special hardware \(em just an X display. Transmitters need some sort of frame
capture hardware. Several different boards are supported so far, with more to
come in future releases.
.PP
The video transmitted is a 320x240 image for NTSC, or 384x288 for PAL. It can
be sent either as 8-bit greyscale, or 24-bit YUV 4:2:2 color. It will be
displayed at the receiver using a 24-bit color visual if one is available. If
not, it will be dithered using whatever the default visual is.  The frame rate
varies with the amount of motion and the bandwidth available. Frame rates of
3\-5 frames/second are typical for the default bandwidth of 128kbps. Some
systems will support higher frame rates if the bandwidth is raised.

.SH OPTIONS
.I nv
allows you to specify various options either on the command line or using X
resources. The list of options is as follows:
.LP
.RS
.nf
.ta \w'-maxBandwidth   'u +\w'nv.maxBandwidth:   'u
.I "Option	X Resource	Default"
-brightness	Nv.brightness:	50
-contrast	Nv.contrast:	50
-interface	Nv.interface:	(primary host name)
-maxBandwidth	Nv.maxBandwidth:	128
-maxFrameRate	Nv.maxFrameRate:	(machine-specific value)
-name	Nv.name:	(username@localhostname)
-recvSize	Nv.recvSize:	normal
-title	Nv.title:	nv (version)
-ttl	Nv.ttl:	16

.PP
All options can be abbreviated to their smallest unique subset (generally a
single letter). In addition to the above list, nv understands the standard
X switch of "-display" to use something other than $DISPLAY. Also, the
"-recvOnly" switch can be provided to skip any attempt to open a frame
grabber.
.PP
The brightness & contrast parameters range from 0 to 100. The maxBandwidth is
specified in kbits/second. The TTL can range from 0 to 255.
.PP
For transmitters, the maxFrameRate parameter ranges from 0 to 15 frames/second,
where 0 is a machine-specific default value. The default max frame rate on the
Indigo is 10 frames/sec.  
.PP
The interface option controls which of the network interfaces is used when
sending. It should be set to the primary multicast interface on a multi-homed
host. Normally, it defaults to the interface corresponding to the primary
host name.
.PP
The recvSize option sets the default size for incoming video windows. It can
be set to half, normal, or double.
.PP
After the options, you can specify a destination address and port number. If
neither is specified, a default address of 224.2.1.0 and port of 4444 is used.
Specifying a unicast address allows for a point-to-point connection.  If a
multicast group address is used, it is taken to be the address both to transmit
to and listen for other transmitters on.
.\"-------------
.SH CONTROLS
.I nv
brings up a control panel when it is run which consists of two or three main
regions, depending on whether a supported video capture board is available.
The top region is a scrollable set of currently available network video
sources \(em an icon sized video window with a name underneath. Clicking on
the icon of the video will toggle the display of a larger video window for
that source. The second region contains conference address info, as well as a
place to set your name. Each of these fields may be editted \(em changes take
affect when <Return> is pressed in a field. The third region appears only when
a video capture board is found. It allows you to set the maximum transmit
bandwidth for your video stream, control whether you're sending greyscale or
color video, and toggle sending on and off. It also has a button to bring up a
list of sites reporting in as viewing you.
.PP
Clicking in video windows will toggle an extra control panel which allows you
to adjust the brightness and contrast of the image. It also displays the IP
source address of the sender and the incoming frame rate and bandwidth
(averaged over the last few seconds). Other controls include a set of size
buttons, a switch to view the video as either greyscale or color (if color is
being sent), and a button which allows you to capture the current image into a
new window.
.PP
Any window may be deleted by using the "quit" option provided by the window
maneger, or by pressing Ctrl-C, ESC, or 'q' in it. If you delete the control
panel window in this fashion, the program will exit.

.SH BUGS
When you start nv on an Indigo with the IndigoVideo board, the following
message may appear several times in the console window: "sv1LoadMap: bad
sv1AddWork".  It's caused by an IndigoVideo driver bug and can be ignored.
