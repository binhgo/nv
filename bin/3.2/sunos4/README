This is the SPARCstation binary distribution of the 'nv' network video tool.
Enclosed is this README file, a man page, and a SPARC executable for SunOS
4.1.x. Video capture support is provided for the Sun VideoPix card. Users
without a VideoPix will be able to use the tool in a receive-only mode.

In addition to the normal nv binary, a file called nv.dyn has been included.
This is version of the program which has been dynamically linked against the
X11 and C libraries. It might be possible to run this on Solaris 2.x machines
in binary compatibility mode. A _real_ Solaris 2.x version of nv will hopefully
be available soon.

'nv' is still very much a work in progress, but hopefully you will find the
program adequate for basic unicast and multicast transmission of video across
the Internet. Comments and suggestions, as well as bug report, are extremely
welcome! Please send any such comments via email to the author, Ron Frederick
<frederick@parc.xerox.com>.
