.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I nv
allows users to transmit and receive slow frame rate video via UDP/IP across
an internet. Video streams can be either sent point to point, or sent to
several destinations simultaneously using IP multicast. Receivers need no
special hardware \(em just an X display. Transmitters need some sort of frame
capture hardware. Several different boards are supported so far, with more to
come in future releases.
.PP
By default, the video transmitted is a 320x240 image for NTSC, or 384x288 for
PAL. It can be sent either as 8-bit greyscale, or 24-bit YUV 4:2:2 color. Other
sizes (both smaller and larger) can also be selected. It will be displayed at
the receiver using a 24-bit color visual if one is available. If not, it will
be dithered using whatever the default visual is.  The frame rate varies with
the amount of motion and the bandwidth available. Frame rates of 3\-5
frames/second are typical for the default bandwidth of 128kbps. Some systems
will support higher frame rates if the bandwidth is raised or smaller images
are sent.

.SH OPTIONS
.I nv
allows you to specify various options either on the command line or using X
resources. The list of options is as follows:
.LP
.RS
.nf
.ta \w'-maxBandwidthLimit   'u +\w'nv.maxBandwidthLimit:   'u
.I "Option	X Resource	Default"
-brightness	Nv.brightness:	60
-contrast	Nv.contrast:	50
-encoding	Nv.encoding:	nv
-grabber	Nv.grabber:	(machine-specific value)
-interface	Nv.interface:	(machine-specific value)
-maxBandwidth	Nv.maxBandwidth:	128
-maxBandwidthLimit	Nv.maxBandwidthLimit:	1024
-maxFrameRate	Nv.maxFrameRate:	(machine-specific value)
-name	Nv.name:	(username@localhostname)
-recvColor \\	Nv.recvColor:	color
-recvGrey  /
-recvSize	Nv.recvSize:	normal
-title	Nv.title:	nv (version)

-xmitColor \\	Nv.xmitColor:	color
-xmitGrey  /

All options can be abbreviated to their smallest unique subset. Note that the
"-recvColor", "-recvGrey", "-xmitColor" and "-xmitGrey" options don't actually
take an argument.
.PP
In addition to the above list, nv understands the standard X switch of
"-display" to use something other than $DISPLAY. Also, the "-recvOnly" switch
can be provided to skip any attempt to open a frame grabber.
.PP
The brightness & contrast parameters range from 0 to 100. The maxBandwidth is
specified in kbits/second. The TTL can range from 0 to 255.
.PP
The grabber and encoding options specify what to use when transmitting video.
By default, nv probes the machine for all the grabbers it supports and uses
the first one it finds, and it sets the encoding to its native compression.
.PP
For transmitters, the maxFrameRate parameter ranges from 0 to 30 frames/second,
where 0 is a machine-specific default value.
.PP
The interface option controls which of the network interfaces is used when
sending. It should be set to the primary multicast interface on a multi-homed
host. Normally, it defaults to the interface corresponding to the primary
host name.
.PP
The recvSize option sets the default size for incoming video windows. It can
be set to half, normal, or double.
.PP
The xmitSize option sets the default size for transmitted video. It can be
set to small, medium, or large.
.PP
After the options, you must specify a destination address. You can optionally
also specify a port number and RTP channel ID. The default port number is 4444,
and the default RTP channel ID is 32. Specifying a unicast address allows for a
point-to-point connection.  If a multicast group address is used, it is taken
to be the address both to transmit to and listen for other transmitters on.
.\"-------------
.SH CONTROLS
.I nv
brings up a control panel when it is run which consists of a menu bar, a box
to show iconic versions of active video streams, and some number of additional
panels. The Info menu lets you see the version of nv you have. The Grabbers
menu lets you select among available grabbers. Grabbers which are supported
but not available on the local host are greyed out. The Encodings menu lets
you select which video encoding to use when transmitting. The Panels menu
allows you to toggle on and off the presence of each additional panel.

The video icon box is scrollable, and shows a small video image with a name
underneath for each video stream it receives. Clicking on that video icon will
toggle the display of a larger video window for that source.

The Conference Info panel contains conference address information, as well as a
place to set your name. Each of these fields may be editted \(em changes take
affect when <Return> is pressed in a field.

The Grabber Control panel allows you to set things specific to the particular
grabber you have selected. Some grabbers may not have a control panel, in which
case this panel item will be unavailable.

The Video Transmit Options panel allows you to set the maximum transmit
bandwidth for your video stream, the size of the transmitted image, and
whether you're sending greyscale or color video. It also has a button to
toggle sending on and off.

The Receive Defaults panel allows you to set the default values of brightness
and contrast for received video. It also lets you set the received size, and
whether to display the video in greyscale or color.
.PP
Clicking in video windows will toggle an extra control panel which allows you
to adjust the brightness and contrast of the image. It also displays the
source address of the sender, the video format,  the incoming and displayed
frame rate, the incoming bandwidth, and an approximate amount of network loss
(averaged over the last few seconds). Other controls include a set of size
buttons, a switch to view the video as either greyscale or color (if color is
being sent), and a button which allows you to capture the current image into a
new window.
.PP
Any window may be deleted by using the "quit" option provided by the window
maneger, or by pressing Ctrl-C, ESC, or 'q' in it. If you delete the control
panel window in this fashion, the program will exit.

.SH BUGS
When you start nv on an Indigo with the IndigoVideo board, the following
message may appear several times in the console window: "sv1LoadMap: bad
sv1AddWork".  It's caused by an IndigoVideo driver bug and can be ignored.
