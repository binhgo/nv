This is the HP9000 binary distribution of the 'nv' network video tool.
Enclosed is this README file, a man page, and an HP9000 executable for HP/UX
9.x. Video capture support is provided for the RasterOps VideoLive board.

'nv' is still very much a work in progress, but hopefully you will find the
program adequate for basic unicast and multicast transmission of video across
the Internet. Comments and suggestions, as well as bug reports, are extremely
welcome! Please send any such comments via email to the author, Ron Frederick
<frederick@parc.xerox.com>.
