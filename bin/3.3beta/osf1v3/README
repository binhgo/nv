This is the DEC Alpha binary distribution of the 'nv' network video tool.
Enclosed is this README file, a man page, and two Alpha executables for OSF/1
release 3.x. Both executables provide support for the DEC J300 Sound & Motion
Video card. To grab from the J300, the binary named 'nv-mme' requires
installation of the MME server and shared library. The binary named 'nv-jv2'
requires installation of the 'jv2driver' program available via anonymous FTP
from:

	ftp://chocolate.pa.dec.com/mbone/j300.tar.Z

The nv-mme binary should also be compatible with the FullVideo Supreme JPEG
AV321 video card if you have the MME server and shared library installed.

If you do not have a video grabber and wish to use nv simply to receive video
or transmit via the X11 screen grabber, you should be able to do so using the
nv-jv2 program without installing either mmeserver or jv2driver.

'nv' is still very much a work in progress, but hopefully you will find the
program adequate for basic unicast and multicast transmission of video across
the Internet. Comments and suggestions, as well as bug reports, are extremely
welcome! Please send any such comments via email to the author, Ron Frederick
