This is the SPARCstation Solaris 2.x binary distribution of the 'nv' network
video tool. Enclosed is this README file, a man page, and a SPARC executable
for SunOS 5.x. Video capture support is provided for the SunVideo card, and
Sun VideoPix card.

'nv' is still very much a work in progress, but hopefully you will find the
program adequate for basic unicast and multicast transmission of video across
the Internet. Comments and suggestions, as well as bug reports, are extremely
welcome! Please send any such comments via email to the author, Ron Frederick
<frederick@parc.xerox.com>.
