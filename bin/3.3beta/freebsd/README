This is the FreeBSD binary distribution of the 'nv' network video tool.
Enclosed is this README file, a man page, and an Intel 80x86 executable for
FreeBSD.

'nv' is still very much a work in progress, but hopefully you will find the
program adequate for basic unicast and multicast transmission of video across
the Internet. Comments and suggestions, as well as bug reports, are extremely
welcome! Please send any such comments via email to the author, Ron Frederick
<frederick@parc.xerox.com>.
