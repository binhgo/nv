This is an early release of a network video tool. The distribution contains
this readme file, a man page, and a SPARCstation executable for SunOS 4.1.x.
Many planned features have not yet made it into this version, but it should
provide basic support for unicasting or multicast Videopix-based video across
the Internet.

Comments and suggestions, as well as bug reports, are extremely welcome! Please
send any such comments to the author, Ron Frederick <frederick@parc.xerox.com>.
General performance numbers (frame rate, mostly) for various kinds of SPARC
hardware under different sorts of load would also be interesting.
