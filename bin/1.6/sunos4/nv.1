.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I nv
allows users to transmit and receive slow frame rate video via UDP/IP across
an internet. Video streams can be either sent point to point, or sent to
several destinations simultaneously using IP multicast. Receivers need no
special hardware -- just an X display. Transmitters need a Sun VideoPix frame
grabber.

The video transmitted is a 320x240 image with 16 levels of greyscale. The
frame rate varies based on system load, but tends to be between 3 and 5
frames/second on a SPARCstation 2. The image is updated at varying resolutions
based on the amount of motion and the bandwidth available. As the image
motion slows down, high resolution data is sent to fill in lost detail.

.SH OPTIONS
.I nv
allows you to specify various options either on the command line or using X
resources. The list of options is as follows:
.LP
.RS
.nf
.ta \w'-maxBandwidth   'u +\w'nv.maxBandwidth:   'u
.I "Option	X Resource	Default"
-brightness	nv.brightness:	60
-contrast	nv.contrast:	60
-maxBandwidth	nv.maxBandwidth:	128
-name	nv.name:	(no default)
-ttl	nv.ttl:	32
.fi
.DT
.RE

All options can be abbreviated to their smallest unique susbet (generally a
single letter). In addition to the above list, nv understands the standard
X switch of "-display" to use something other than $DISPLAY.

The brightness & contrast parameters range from 0 to 100. The maxBandwidth is
specified in kbits/second. The TTL can range from 0 to 255.

After the options, you can specify a destination address and port number. If
neither is specified, a default address of 224.2.1.0 and port of 4444 is used.
Specifying a unicast address allows for a point to point connection.  If a
multicast group address is used, it is taken to be the address both to transmit
to and listen for other transmitters on.

.SH CONTROLS
.I nv
brings up a control panel when it is run which consists of two main regions.
The top region is a list of currently available network video sources -- a list
of names with a checkbox next to each. Clicking on a name will toggle whether
the video from that source is being displayed.

The bottom region of the window only appears when a VideoPix card is available
for transmitting video. This window contains several controls that can be used
to adjust the characteristics of the transmitted video. There are sliders to
set the brightness & contrast of the image being sent out, and to put a limit
on the maximum bandwidth which will be used. Also, the name sent along with the
window and the TTL used in sending multicast packets can be changed. At the
very bottom of the window is a button to toggle transmission on and off, and a
button to show which other sites are presently receiving your video. A status
display of the frame rate & bandwidth used (averaged over the last few seconds)
is present as well.

To exit the program, type Ctrl-C or 'q' in the control panel or any of the
video windows.

.SH BUGS
.I nv
presently doesn't deal properly with "delete window" requests from X. That will
be handled correctly when the next version of the Tk toolkit is released. Also,
iconifying video windows can cause some confusion. To close a video window,
click on that name in the control panel.
