v1.6 - Thu Dec  3 1992

Added support for a larger window for PAL images, to capture the full sized
image and do proper square pixel correction.

Note: This change is incompatible with previous 'nv' programs. Sending and
receiving NTSC images remains fully compatible, but senders of PAL images can
now only be received with nv version 1.6.

v1.5 - Thu Nov 19 1992

Added support for capturing still images of a video window at the receiver. To
capture, click with the third button in the active window. A new window will
appear with the captured image. Clicking with the third button in the captured
window deletes it.

Fixed a bug related to checking for the -display command line argument.

v1.4 - Wed Nov 18 1992

Fixed a problem in the VideoPix initialization which caused color information
to produce some weird patterns in the grabbed image.


v1.3 - Tue Nov 17 1992

Added command line versions of all the options you could set with X resources.

Fixed the display checking code to allow for GrayScale in addition to
PseudoColor displays.

Attempted to bind to the multicast address explicitly, for hosts which have the
patched version of netinet/in_pcb.c.


v1.2 - Mon Nov 16 1992

Added a "Show receivers" box to the transmit window, which brings up a list of
all hosts that have identified themselves as watching your video stream. These
identifications are sent back via unicast to the port that the video originates
from.


v1.1 - Sat Nov 14 1992

Cleaned up a few minor cosmetic features, such as the error message that was
printed on hosts that didn't have a Videopix card. Also, fixed a bug related to
iconifying the video windows.


v1.0 - Thu Nov 12 1992

First public release.
