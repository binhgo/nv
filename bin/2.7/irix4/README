This is the SGI Iris binary distribution of the 'nv' network video tool.
Enclosed is this README file, a man page, and an IRIS-4D executable for Irix
4.0.x. Video capture support is provided for the IndigoVideo card. Users
without the IndigoVideo will be able to use the tool in a receive-only mode.

'nv' is still very much a work in progress, but hopefully you will find the
program adequate for basic unicast and multicast transmission of video across
the Internet. Comments and suggestions, as well as bug report, are extremely
welcome! Please send any such comments via email to the author, Ron Frederick
<frederick@parc.xerox.com>.
